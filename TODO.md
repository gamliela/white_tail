* multiple anonymous classes are not supported (e.g. multiple "within" command in same section) might conflict. we need a separate class to each one.

__Can wait until we have more commands/experience__

* Revisit param validations on all command classes (e.g. assign)

* remove duplications in list commands in script_builder.rb

* too many node classes: text and attribute can be just field, section can be script or even record (more genereic)
